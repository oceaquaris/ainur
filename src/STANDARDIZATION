STANDARDIZATION among ainur source code

Function Naming:
    * A function is to be named with the prefix '<file>_' to denote the
      origin of a that function.

          For example, functions in ainur.c may be named:
            - ainur_red()
            - ainur_blue()
            - ainur_green()

    * If a function is to be part of a group, use a '_' to separate prefix
      and suffixes.

          For example:
            - ainur_paint_red()
            - ainur_paint_blue()
            - ainur_paint_green()

    * Function suffixes are to be named using camelCase.

          For example:
            - ainur_blackWhite()
            - ainur_redGreen()
            - ainur_blueOrange()


Library / Variable initialization/termination
    * If a library and/or a variable needs to be initialized before use, a
      function should be named with the name: '<file>[_<lib,var>]_init()'
      ( [_<lib,var>] is optional )

          For example, to initialize the ainur library:
            - ainur_init()

    * If a library and/or a variable needs to be terminated after use, a
      function should be named with the name: '<file>[_<lib,var>]_close()'
      ( [_<lib,var>] is optional )

          For example, to terminate the ainur library:
            - ainur_close()
